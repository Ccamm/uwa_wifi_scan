# CITS4419 Project: Scanning WiFi Access Points on Outside Paths at UWA
### By Alex Brown (21955725) and Akhil Naseem (22237476)

Project report and code for analysing collected data is in the notebook
`display_measurement.ipynb`.

The pdf report `report.pdf` can also be used to read the report, but due to
issues with rendering the maps as images it is prefferred to read the jupyter
notebook.
